.. list-table:: eCAL 5.13 vs. 5.12
   :widths: 20 80

   * - Wire compatibility
     
     - * **eCAL UDP**: 100% compatible
  
       * **eCAL TCP**: 100% compatible

       * **Services**: 100% compatible (**New protocol**, but downwards and upwards compatible)
         
         eCAL 5.13 introduces a new protocol that fixes issues of the old protocol.
         Both protocols (v0 and v1) are supported and nodes agree on the best supported protocol before establishing a connection.

         When communicating with old nodes (eCAL 5.12 and older), the faulty v0 protocol is used.

       * **eCAL Shared Memory**: 100% compatible

       * **eCAL Registration Layer**: 100% compatible

         New fields have been added to support the new service protocol.

   * - API / ABI

     - * **API**: downwards compatible.
         
         A lot of deprecations were added.
         Users should make sure to only use non-deprecated API and files in order to later make upgrading to eCAL 6 easier.
         Deprecations can be found :ref:`in this document <compatibility_details_5_13_deprecations>`
         
       * **ABI**: not compatible

   * - Tools

     - The **GUI Tools** now support being compiled against Qt6.
       Official Windows builds are now shipped with Qt 6.6 by default.
       Therefore, custom **eCAL Mon Plugins for Windows** have to be **re-compiled with Qt 6.6** as well.
       
       * **Rec**: 100% compatible

       * **Sys**: 100% compatible

       * **Measurements**: 100% compatible
