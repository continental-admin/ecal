eCAL Sys Overview
=================

In this chapter we will take a deeper look at eCAl Sys.
We will discuss the Host / Client architecture and look at all available configuration options and functions in the GUI.

.. seealso::

   If you are new to eCAL Sys, please first check out the :ref:`Getting Started with eCAL Sys <getting_started_sys>` chapter.
   That chapter will teach you the very basics of eCAL Sys.

   If you don't want to use the GUI, please see the :ref:`applications_sys_cli` chapter.

Architecture
============

eCAL Sys consists of 2 (or 3) applications:

#. The **Host Application**.
   This can be either one of:

   - eCAL Sys GUI (:file:`ecal_sys_gui /.exe`)
   - eCAL Sys CLI (:file:`ecal_sys /.exe`)

   The Host Application is started only once on the machine that is supposed to control everything else.
   This application is responsible for loading the configuration file and keeping track of all task states.

#. The **Client Application** (:file:`ecal_sys_client /.exe`). 

   The Client Application is started on all machines that shall be remote-controlled.
   It creates an eCAL Service and gets remote-controlled by the eCAL Sys Host Application.

   The eCAL Sys Client is not needed on the machine, where the Host Application is running.

   .. note::

      The eCAL Sys Client is a remote control application with not authentication.
      If you are annoyed by accepting this security implication at startup, you can start eCAL Sys Client with:

      .. code-block:: console

         ecal_sys_client --auto-accept-security-risk

#. The **Machine Monitoring Application** (:file:`ecal_mma /.exe`). 

   This application is not required for eCAL Sys itself.
   However, eCAL Sys will display information about system resources of all systems that run an ecal_mma:

   .. tip::

      You can use eCAL Sys to start the MMA Application, by creating an ``ecal_mma`` task.

Configuration
=============

eCAL Sys saves configuration files with the ``.ecalsys`` extension.
Those files contain a regular XML description of the configuration.
Although you could write .ecalsys files by hand, it is much easier to use eCAL Sys GUI for that.
The command line application (eCAL Sys CLI) can only load .ecalsys files, but not write them.

So let's look at all of the things you can configure with eCAL Sys GUI.

Tasks
-----

.. image:: img/ecal_sys_task_overview.png
   :alt: eCAL Sys Task Overview

- **Name**:
  The task name that you can choose freely.
  It is used for displaying in the GUI.
  When using eCAL Sys CLI or controlling eCAL Sys with the eCAL Service, you can also use this name to start / stop / restart tasks by name.

- **Properties**:

  - **Target**:
    The hostname where the tasks shall be started.

  - **Runner**:
    The runner that shall be used for the task.
    Please see the :ref:`Runner Section<applications_sys_runner>` below.

  - **Algo**:
    The command you want to have executed on the target.
    Usually this is a path to an executable.

  - **Working dir**:
    If given, the task will be started in this working directory.

  - **Cmd args**:
    Additional arguments that thall be appended to the command line when starting the task

- **Start Attributes**:

  - **Visibility**:
    Whether the window of the started task shall be normal, maximized or minimized.
    Only supported on Microsoft Windows.

    When using a terminal emulator on linux (see :ref:`ecal.ini<ecalini_option_terminal_emulator>`), the option *minimized* will prevent opening a terminal emulator and the process will print its output in the ecal_sys_client terminal as usual.
    
  - **Launch order**:
    Defines the order of tasks that must be started serialized.
    Tasks with a lower launch order are started first.
    Tasks that share the same launch order may be started in parallel, there are no guarantees about the order.    

  - **Waiting time**:
    How many milliseconds eCAL Sys has to wait after starting the task.
    Use this if one of your task needs some time for startup and you don't want other tasks being started during that period.
    
    Be aware that other tasks sharing the same launch order are still started in parallel.
    eCAL Sys will shedule the timout after all tasks with the current launch order number have been started.

- **Monitoring**:

  - **Enable Monitoring**:
    Untick this option to prevent eCAL Sys from displaying the monitoring information.

  - **Restart by severity**:
    Use this option if you want your task to be automatically restarted once it reports an error.
    The task will be killed by means of the operating system.

    If you ever tend to use this option, you should consider writing better tasks.
    It is usually advisable to make the task handle it's own error and not kill and restart it.


.. _applications_sys_runner:

Runners
-------

A runner is an executable that you want to execute multiple times with different parameters.
Often a runner will load a file, e.g. a .dll file that it will then execute, but it can just as well only receive command line arguments that modify its behaviour.

To manage the runners, you can click :guilabel:`View / Runners` or click the |ecalicons_EYE| icon.

.. note::
   You can do anything a runner can do with just plain tasks.
   The runners are only there to help you not typing the same path over and over again.

- **Name**:
  The name of your runner.
  This name will be displayed in the combobox in the task editor.

- **Path**:
  The path to your runner's executable.

- **Default algo dir**:
  The directory where you want the runner to look for the (algo-) file you provide.
  
  Note that this is not the working directory, from which the runner is started!
  If your runner has a default algo dir configured and you enter an algo that is detected to be a relative path, this path will be interpreted to be relative to your default algo path.

- **Command arg**:
  The command that shall be used to load your algo.
  If empty, the algo will simply be appended on the command line.

The example screenshot shows a Windows Notepad Runner, that will look for the files on my Desktop.
There is no Runner command argument.
The given algo (``my_file.txt``) is a relative path, so eCAL Sys will use the default algo dir.
The resulting command line for the selected task (Notepad 1) will be:

.. code-block::

   C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe "C:\Users\Florian\Desktop\my_file.txt"
